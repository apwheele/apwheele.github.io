<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>These are my tutorials for my crime analysis course. They are mostly in Excel, although a few show how to use SQL in Access, and one shows how to make BOLOs in Publisher. Materials are all posted online to run through the tutorials. If links don't work, send me an email (apwheele@gmail.com). Feel free to use as you wish (if an instructor feel free to email for example final product I used for class).</p>
<p>For a rough outline of the weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lab 01: (Excel) Intro to Excel &amp; making a graph</li>
<li>Lab 02: (Excel) Pivot Tables in Excel</li>
<li>Lab 03: (Excel) Time Series Analysis</li>
<li>Lab 04: (Excel) Mapping Facilities in Excel (needs Windows to use many of these)</li>
<li>Lab 05: (Excel &amp; Near-Repeat Tool) Aoristic analysis and near-repeat analysis</li>
<li>Lab 06: (Excel) Weighted Displacement Difference test</li>
<li>Lab 07: (Publisher) Creating Bulletin in <em>Publisher</em></li>
<li>Lab 08: (Access) Using SQL to create Social Network</li>
<li>Lab 09: (Access) Using SQL to create chronic offender scores</li>
<li>Lab 10: Empty (so far!)</li>
<li>Lab 11: (Excel) Creating an officer dashboard using conditional highlighting, sparklines, making a nice print layout. Also makes a funnel chart.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Lab 12 I had students do their own analysis of the Texas Deaths in Custody dataset. I have a prepared <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ibhekkzqces16hm/Lab12_CustodyDeaths.zip?dl=0">Excel file here</a>, which also includes offender counts in each facility.</p>
<h1 id="todo">ToDo</h1>
<p>This is my list of things I want to incorporate into the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lab 04: Use VLOOKUP to make bins for choropleth maps (continuous ramp is not very nice)</li>
<li>Lab 05: need to update near-repeat analysis to different tool, since Jerryâ€™s has a coding bug at the moment</li>
<li>Lab 06: update to incorporate <a href="https://andrewpwheeler.wordpress.com/2019/10/30/actively-monitoring-place-based-crime-interventions/">cusum charts for evaluation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have other suggestions always feel free!</p>
<p>Also check out my <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~Andrew.Wheeler/OnlineGISCrime_AllLessons_Share/">intro to crime mapping course tutorials</a>, mostly using ArcGIS, some R and GeoDa, as well.</p>
