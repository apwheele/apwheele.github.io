# Github pages code for classes
 
Slowly migrating from UTD account (that is no longer activate) to here for my classes I've prepared. Currently have:

 - Crime Analysis (Upper level undergrad class)
 - Crime Mapping (Masters level GIS course focused on crime mapping)

Since I have these materials already prepared, if you are looking for an adjunct to teach online courses always feel free. 

# ToDo

 - Crime Mapping materials need to be updated to Pro (need to get Eric's book!)
 - Update to include various interactive graphs I have posted in the past:
